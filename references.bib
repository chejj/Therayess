  abstract = {Abstract             Recent substantial evidence implicating commensal bacteria in human diseases has given rise to a new domain in biomedical research: microbiome medicine. This emerging field aims to understand and leverage the human microbiota and derivative molecules for disease prevention and treatment. Despite the complex and hierarchical organization of this ecosystem, most research over the years has relied on 16S amplicon sequencing, a legacy of bacterial phylogeny and taxonomy. Although advanced sequencing technologies have enabled cost-effective analysis of entire microbiota, translating the relatively short nucleotide information into the functional and taxonomic organization of the microbiome has posed challenges until recently. In the last decade, genome-resolved metagenomics, which aims to reconstruct microbial genomes directly from whole-metagenome sequencing data, has made significant strides and continues to unveil the mysteries of various human-associated microbial communities. There has been a rapid increase in the volume of whole metagenome sequencing data and in the compilation of novel metagenome-assembled genomes and protein sequences in public depositories. This review provides an overview of the capabilities and methods of genome-resolved metagenomics for studying the human microbiome, with a focus on investigating the prokaryotic microbiota of the human gut. Just as decoding the human genome and its variations marked the beginning of the genomic medicine era, unraveling the genomes of commensal microbes and their sequence variations is ushering us into the era of microbiome medicine. Genome-resolved metagenomics stands as a pivotal tool in this transition and can accelerate our journey toward achieving these scientific and medical milestones.},

We developed curatedMetagenomicData (cMD) 3, a uniformly processed collection of over 22,000 human microbiome samples with manually curated metadata from 94 studies and 42 countries. This large and diverse resource allows for meta-analysis of the links between microbes and human health. Through meta-analysis, we identified hundreds of microbial species and thousands of microbial functions significantly associated with a person's sex, age, body mass index, and disease status, and catalog these as references. We developed an ``oral enrichment score'' (OES) based on the relative abundance of bacteria typically found in the oral cavity and not in the gut. Higher OES in the gut is a consistent feature in individuals with disease, suggesting that the relative abundance of oral bacteria in the gut is a simple and quantifiable signal of altered microbiome health. These analyses identify modest but widely shared patterns in human microbiomes, serving as a reproducible and readily updatable reference.},

  abstract = {The microbiome of the gut is a complex ecosystem that contains a wide variety of microbial species and functional capabilities. The microbiome has a significant impact on health and disease by affecting endocrinology, physiology, and neurology. It can change the progression of certain diseases and enhance treatment responses and tolerance. The gut microbiota plays a pivotal role in human health, influencing a wide range of physiological processes. Recent advances in computational tools and artificial intelligence (AI) have revolutionized the study of gut microbiota, enabling the identification of biomarkers that are critical for diagnosing and treating various diseases. This review hunts through the cutting-edge computational methodologies that integrate multi-omics data---such as metagenomics, metaproteomics, and metabolomics---providing a comprehensive understanding of the gut microbiome's composition and function. Additionally, machine learning (ML) approaches, including deep learning and network-based methods, are explored for their ability to uncover complex patterns within microbiome data, offering unprecedented insights into microbial interactions and their link to host health. By highlighting the synergy between traditional bioinformatics tools and advanced AI techniques, this review underscores the potential of these approaches in enhancing biomarker discovery and developing personalized therapeutic strategies. The convergence of computational advancements and microbiome research marks a significant step forward in precision medicine, paving the way for novel diagnostics and treatments tailored to individual microbiome profiles. Investigators have the ability to discover connections between the composition of microorganisms, the expression of genes, and the profiles of metabolites. Individual reactions to medicines that target gut microbes can be predicted by models driven by artificial intelligence. It is possible to obtain personalized and precision medicine by first gaining an understanding of the impact that the gut microbiota has on the development of disease. The application of machine learning allows for the customization of treatments to the specific microbial environment of an individual.},

The specific tools and parameters used in model construction such as data preprocessing, batch effect removal and modeling algorithms can impact model performance and generalizability. To establish an generally applicable workflow, we divided the ML process into three above-mentioned steps and optimized each sequentially using 83 gut microbiome cohorts across 20 diseases. We tested a total of 156 tool-parameter-algorithm combinations and benchmarked them according to internal- and external- AUCs. At the data preprocessing step, we identified four data preprocessing methods that performed well for regression-type algorithms and one method that excelled for non-regression-type algorithms. At the batch effect removal step, we identified the ``ComBat'' function from the sva R package as an effective batch effect removal method and compared the performance of various algorithms. Finally, at the ML algorithm selection step, we found that Ridge and Random Forest ranked the best. Our optimized work flow performed similarly comparing with previous exhaustive methods for disease-specific optimizations, thus is generally applicable and can provide a comprehensive guideline for constructing diagnostic models for a range of diseases, potentially serving as a powerful tool for future medical diagnostics.},

Due to its involvement in a variety of interactions, gut microorganisms have a great impact on our health throughout our lives. The impact of gut microbial population is been studied intensively in last two decades. Extensive literature survey focusing developments in the field were searched in English language Electronic Databases like PubMed, Google Scholar, Pubag, Google books, and Research Gate were mostly used to understand the role of human gut mirobiome and its role in different human diseases. Gut microbiome in healthy subjects differs from those who suffer from diseases. Type 2 diabetes, obesity, non-alcoholic liver disease, and cardiometabolic diseases have all been linked to dysbiosis of the gut microbiota. Pathogenesis of many disorders is also linked to changes in gut microbiota. Other diseases like cancer, arithritis, autism, depression, anxiety, sleep disorder, HIV, hypertension, and gout are also related to gut microbiota dysbiosis. We focus in this review on recent studies looking into the link between gut microbiome dysbiosis and disease etiology. Research on how gut microbiota affects host metabolism has been changed in past decades from descriptive analyses to high throughput integrative omics data analysis such as metagenomics and metabolomics. Identification of molecular mechanisms behind reported associations is been carried out in human, animals, and cells for measure of host physiology and mechanics. Still many the mechanisms are not completely understood.},

  abstract = {The area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) is a standard metric for quantifying and comparing binary classifiers. Real world applications often require classification into multiple (more than two) classes. For multi-class classifiers that produce class membership scores, a popular multi-class AUC (MAUC) variant is to average the pairwise AUC values [1]. Due to the complicated correlation patterns, the variance of MAUC is often estimated numerically using resampling techniques. This work is a generalization of DeLong's nonparameteric approach for binary AUC analysis [2] to MAUC. We first derive the closed-form expression of the covariance matrix of the pairwise AUCs within a single MAUC. Then by dropping higher order terms, we obtain an approximate covariance matrix with a compact, matrix factorization form, which then serves as the basis for variance estimation of a single MAUC. We further extend this approach to estimate the covariance of correlated MAUCs that arise from multiple competing classifiers. For the special case of binary correlated AUCs, our results coincide with that of DeLong. Our numerical studies confirm the accuracy of the variance and covariance estimates. We provide the source code of the proposed covariance estimation of correlated MAUCs on GitHub (https://tinyurl.com/euj6wvsz) for its easy adoption by machine learning and statistical analysis packages to quantify and compare multi-class classifiers.},

  abstract = {Background The stigma caused by colorectal cancer (CRC) and CRC screening affects CRC prevention and treatment. Based on the Health Stigma and Discrimination Framework (HSDF), this review analyzed the influencing factors and mechanism of stigma in CRC. Methods We conducted a scoping review in accordance with the PRISMA-ScR guidelines and searched PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and CNKI. The RoBANS tool was used for quantitative studies, and the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklist for Qualitative Research tool was used for qualitative studies. Data were integrated on the basis of the HSDF. Results Among the 15 included studies, 10 focused on CRC patients, and 5 focused on screening participants. These studies covered driving factors (14 studies), facilitating factors (11 studies), stigma ``marking'' (13 studies), individual experiences (12 studies), and social practices (13 studies). Additionally, a total of 3150 participants were included in the studies, comprising 2876 patients and 274 screening participants. Studies have shown that the factors influencing CRC-related stigma differ across different groups. CRC patients experience disease-related stigma and survival-related stigma, such as ostomy discrimination and employment discrimination. The screening of participants involves invasive examinations and asymptomatic population screening. The above stigmatization may lead to negative consequences such as deterioration in quality of life, decreased treatment compliance, delayed screening, and psychological distress (anxiety, depression). This study revealed that CRC-related stigma may be influenced by age, gender, religion, culture and the economy. Through improving social support and health policy, the negative effects of stigmatization can be gradually eliminated. Conclusion CRC-related stigma has measurable impacts on patient well-being and care-seeking. Although some studies suggest potential strategies to reduce stigma, further research is needed to evaluate effective interventions and their role in promoting screening participation.

However, we hypothesized that stool is a poor proxy for the inner-colonic microbiome and that studying stool samples may be inadequate to capture the true inner-colonic microbiome. To test this hypothesis, we conducted prospective clinical studies with up to 20 patients undergoing an FDA-cleared gravity-fed colonic lavage without oral purgative pre-consumption. The objective of this study was to present the analysis of inner-colonic microbiota obtained non-invasively during the lavage and how these results differ from stool samples. The inner-colonic samples represented the descending, transverse, and ascending colon. All samples were analyzed for 16S rRNA and shotgun metagenomic sequences. The taxonomic, phylogenetic, and biosynthetic gene cluster analyses showed a distinctive biogeographic gradient and revealed differences between the sample types, especially in the proximal colon. The high percentage of unique information found only in the inner-colonic effluent highlights the importance of these samples and likewise the importance of collecting them using a method that can preserve these distinctive signatures. We proposed that these samples are imperative for developing future biomarkers, targeted therapeutics, and personalized medicine.},

'patchwork' is a package that expands the API to allow for  arbitrarily complex composition of plots by, among others, providing  mathematical operators for combining multiple plots. Other packages that try  to address this need (but with a different approach) are 'gridExtra' and  'cowplot'.},

  abstract = {In most cases of sporadic colorectal cancers, tumorigenesis is a multistep process, involving genomic alterations in parallel with morphologic changes. In addition, accumulating evidence suggests that the human gut microbiome is linked to the development of colorectal cancer. Here we performed fecal metagenomic and metabolomic studies on samples from a large cohort of 616\,participants who underwent colonoscopy to assess taxonomic and functional characteristics of gut microbiota and metabolites. Microbiome and metabolome shifts were apparent in cases of multiple polypoid adenomas and intramucosal carcinomas, in addition to more advanced lesions. We found two distinct patterns of microbiome elevations. First, the relative abundance of Fusobacterium nucleatum spp. was significantly (P\,{$<$}\,0.005) elevated continuously from intramucosal carcinoma to more advanced stages. Second, Atopobium parvulum and Actinomyces odontolyticus, which co-occurred in intramucosal carcinomas, were significantly (P\,{$<$}\,0.005) increased only in multiple polypoid adenomas and/or intramucosal carcinomas. Metabolome analyses showed that branched-chain amino acids and phenylalanine were significantly (P\,{$<$}\,0.005) increased in intramucosal carcinomas and bile acids, including deoxycholate, were significantly (P\,{$<$}\,0.005) elevated in multiple polypoid adenomas and/or intramucosal carcinomas. We identified metagenomic and metabolomic markers to discriminate cases of intramucosal carcinoma from the healthy controls. Our large-cohort multi-omics data indicate that shifts in the microbiome and metabolome occur from the very early stages of the development of colorectal cancer, which is of possible etiological and diagnostic importance.}
