## Overview

This project investigates gut microbiome patterns associated with colorectal cancer (CRC) using publicly available metagenomic stool datasets. The analysis includes data curation, exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical modeling, and machine learning approaches to evaluate microbial differences across disease states.

## Data Source

Data were obtained from the curatedMetagenomicData (cMD3) Bioconductor resource and filtered to include adult stool samples with relevant disease annotations.

## Methods

- Data filtering and harmonization

- Exploratory data analysis

- Statistical modeling

- Random Forest classification

## Tools

Analysis was conducted in R using packages from the tidyverse ecosystem, vegan, mia, and related microbiome analysis tools. Reports were generated using Quarto.
