  abstract = {Abstract             Recent substantial evidence implicating commensal bacteria in human diseases has given rise to a new domain in biomedical research: microbiome medicine. This emerging field aims to understand and leverage the human microbiota and derivative molecules for disease prevention and treatment. Despite the complex and hierarchical organization of this ecosystem, most research over the years has relied on 16S amplicon sequencing, a legacy of bacterial phylogeny and taxonomy. Although advanced sequencing technologies have enabled cost-effective analysis of entire microbiota, translating the relatively short nucleotide information into the functional and taxonomic organization of the microbiome has posed challenges until recently. In the last decade, genome-resolved metagenomics, which aims to reconstruct microbial genomes directly from whole-metagenome sequencing data, has made significant strides and continues to unveil the mysteries of various human-associated microbial communities. There has been a rapid increase in the volume of whole metagenome sequencing data and in the compilation of novel metagenome-assembled genomes and protein sequences in public depositories. This review provides an overview of the capabilities and methods of genome-resolved metagenomics for studying the human microbiome, with a focus on investigating the prokaryotic microbiota of the human gut. Just as decoding the human genome and its variations marked the beginning of the genomic medicine era, unraveling the genomes of commensal microbes and their sequence variations is ushering us into the era of microbiome medicine. Genome-resolved metagenomics stands as a pivotal tool in this transition and can accelerate our journey toward achieving these scientific and medical milestones.},

This large and diverse resource allows for meta-analysis of the links between microbes and human health. Through meta-analysis, we identified hundreds of microbial species and thousands of microbial functions significantly associated with a person's sex, age, body mass index, and disease status, and catalog these as references. We developed an ``oral enrichment score'' (OES) based on the relative abundance of bacteria typically found in the oral cavity and not in the gut. Higher OES in the gut is a consistent feature in individuals with disease, suggesting that the relative abundance of oral bacteria in the gut is a simple and quantifiable signal of altered microbiome health. These analyses identify modest but widely shared patterns in human microbiomes, serving as a reproducible and readily updatable reference.},

However, there remain limitations and theoretical gaps in our current understanding of the intricate relationship between microbes and humans. In this narrative review, we integrate the knowledge and insights from various fields, including anatomy, physiology, immunology, histology, genetics, and evolution, to propose a systematic framework. It introduces key concepts such as the `innate and adaptive genomes', which enhance genetic and evolutionary comprehension of the human genome. The `germ-free syndrome' challenges the traditional `microbes as pathogens' view, advocating for the necessity of microbes for health. The `slave tissue' concept underscores the symbiotic intricacies between human tissues and their microbial counterparts, highlighting the dynamic health implications of microbial interactions. `Acquired microbial immunity' positions the microbiome as an adjunct to human immune systems, providing a rationale for probiotic therapies and prudent antibiotic use. The `homeostatic reprogramming hypothesis' integrates the microbiome into the internal environment theory, potentially explaining the change in homeostatic indicators post-industrialization. The `cell-microbe co-ecology model' elucidates the symbiotic regulation affecting cellular balance, while the `meta-host model' broadens the host definition to include symbiotic microbes. The `health-illness conversion model' encapsulates the innate and adaptive genomes' interplay and dysbiosis patterns. The aim here is to provide a more focused and coherent understanding of microbiome and highlight future research avenues that could lead to a more effective and efficient healthcare system.},

In this review, we present an overview of current host DNA depletion approaches along with explanations of their underlying principles, advantages and disadvantages.

The human gastrointestinal tract constitutes a hospitable environment in which a plethora of microbes, including diverse species of archaea, bacteria, fungi, and microeukaryotes as well as viruses, inhabit. In particular, the gut microbiome is the largest microbiome community in the human body and has drawn for decades the attention of scientists for its significance in medical microbiology. Revolutions in sequencing techniques, including 16S rRNA and ITS amplicon sequencing and whole genome sequencing, facilitate the detection of microbiomes and have opened new vistas in the study of human microbiota. Especially, the flourishing fields of metagenomics and metatranscriptomics aim to detect all genomes and transcriptomes that are retrieved from environmental and human samples. The present review highlights the complexity of the gastrointestinal tract microbiome and deciphers its implication not only in cellular homeostasis but also in human diseases.

  abstract = {A global rise in antimicrobial resistance among pathogenic bacteria has proved to be a major public health threat, with the rate of multidrug-resistant bacterial infections increasing over time. The gut microbiome has been studied as a reservoir of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) that can be transferred to bacterial pathogens via horizontal gene transfer (HGT) of conjugative plasmids and mobile genetic elements (the gut resistome). Advances in metagenomic sequencing have facilitated the identification of resistome modulators, including live microbial therapeutics such as probiotics and fecal microbiome transplantation that can either expand or reduce the abundances of ARG-carrying bacteria in the gut. While many different gut microbes encode for ARGs, they are not uniformly distributed across, or transmitted by, various members of the microbiome, and not all are of equal clinical relevance. Both experimental and theoretical approaches in microbial ecology have been applied to understand differing frequencies of ARG horizontal transfer between commensal microbes as well as between commensals and pathogens. In this commentary, we assess the evidence for the role of commensal gut microbes in encoding antimicrobial resistance genes, the degree to which they are shared both with other commensals and with pathogens, and the host and environmental factors that can impact resistome dynamics. We further discuss novel sequencing-based approaches for identifying ARGs and predicting future transfer events of clinically relevant ARGs from commensals to pathogens.},

However, taxa identifications produced through metabarcoding require sophisticated processing of high-throughput sequencing data from taxonomically informative DNA barcodes. Various sets of universal and taxon-specific primers have been developed, extending the usability of metabarcoding across archaea, bacteria and eukaryotes. Accordingly, a multitude of metabarcoding data analysis tools and pipelines have also been developed. Often, several developed workflows are designed to process the same amplicon sequencing data, making it somewhat puzzling to choose one among the plethora of existing pipelines. However, each pipeline has its own specific philosophy, strengths and limitations, which should be considered depending on the aims of any specific study, as well as the bioinformatics expertise of the user. In this review, we outline the input data requirements, supported operating systems and particular attributes of thirtytwo amplicon processing pipelines with the goal of helping users to select a pipeline for their metabarcoding projects.},

The high-throughput nature of NGS and the complex data processing required has driven the need for advanced computational infrastructures to analyse these large datasets. The aim of this work is to introduce an innovative bioinformatic pipeline, named GeNePi, for the efficient and precise analysis of WGS short paired-end reads. Built on the Nextflow framework with a modular structure, GeNePi incorporates GPU-accelerated algorithms and supports multiple workflow configurations. The pipeline automates the extraction of biologically relevant insights from raw WGS data, including: disease-related variants such as single nucleotide variants (SNVs), small insertions or deletions (INDELs), copy number variants (CNVs), and structural variants (SVs). Optimized for high-performance computing (HPC) environments, it takes advantage of job-scheduler submissions, parallelised processing, and tailored resource allocation for each analysis step. Tested on synthetic and real datasets, GeNePi accurately identifies genomic variants, with performances comparable to that of state-of-art tools. These features make GeNePi a valuable instrument for large-scale analyses in both research and clinical contexts, representing a key step towards the establishment of National Centers for Computational and Technological Medicine.},

High antimicrobial resistance (AMR) prevalence in LMICs reduces treatment options for individuals at risk of severe infections.Methods. We investigated the use of metagenomics to identify NTS and associated AMR genes in 28 faecal metagenomes from children with culture-confirmed salmonellosis in Vietnam, using accompanying NTS genomes from isolated serovars (one per metagenome). Read-based and assembly-based methods were utilised for NTS and AMR detection. Case metagenomes were compared to healthy control metagenomes (n=21) with respect to the microbiome composition, NTS relative abundances, number of unique AMR genes and antimicrobial classes to which the genes confer resistance, including classes used in Salmonella treatment.Results. Salmonellosis cases displayed significantly higher relative abundances of Enterobacteriaceae than controls. Bracken and Centrifuge analysis facilitated the identification of Salmonella enterica sequences in case metagenomes at varying relative abundances (0.00259-27.7{$\mkern1mu\%$} of total reads), which were significantly higher than controls. MetaPhlAn4 did not detect S. enterica in any control metagenomes, though 12 case metagenomes were also negative. The isolated serovars were identified in 78.6\% of the associated case metagenomes with Centrifuge, suggesting this method is the most sensitive; however, the isolated genome serovar was the most abundant in only six case metagenomes, and serovar sequences were also identified in control metagenomes. Alignment to a Salmonella reference database, followed by local assembly and realignment, predicted the isolated serovar as the most likely serovar present in 35.7\% of metagenomes, whereas Salmonella in silico typing resource classification of the local assembly was concordant with the isolate genome in 28.6\% of cases. Metagenome-assembled genomes produced using two tools following de novo assembly identified the isolated serovar in 17.8-21.4\% of cases. The percentage of NTS AMR genes identified in each case metagenome ranged between 0.00 and 100\%. There was no significant difference in the number of unique AMR genes or antimicrobial classes between cases and controls, indicating comparable resistomes between cohorts.Conclusions. This study highlights the potential of metagenomics for NTS identification in faecal samples, although overlap in S. enterica relative abundance between cohorts calls for further work to identify a diagnostic cutoff. Reliable characterisation of the organism to the serovar and AMR genotype level is affected by the complexity of the microbiome, sequencing and analysis approaches. Increased sequencing depth, for example through improved host DNA depletion, may facilitate enhanced characterisation. Detection of multiple serovars within individual samples with the Centrifuge suggests inaccurate classification or the presence of multiple serovars, making characterisation difficult.},

While metagenomics theoretically provides information on all strains in a sample, current strain-resolved analysis methods face a tradeoff: de novo genotyping approaches can detect novel strains but struggle when applied to strain-rich or low-coverage samples, while reference database methods work robustly across sample types but are insensitive to novel diversity. We present PHLAME, a method that bridges this divide by combining the advantages of reference database approaches with novelty awareness. PHLAME explicitly defines clades at multiple phylogenetic levels and introduces a probabilistic, mutation-based framework to quantify novelty from the nearest reference. By applying PHLAME to publicly available human skin and vaginal metagenomes, we find clade associations with coexisting species, geography, and host age. The ability to characterize intraspecies associations and dynamics in previously inaccessible environments will enable strain-level insights from accumulating metagenomic data.},

  abstract = {Soil-transmitted helminths (STH) are common in (sub)tropical regions and primarily affect impoverished populations. These parasites reside in the gut, where they interact with both the microbiota and host immunity. Clinical STH detection is laborious and often not performed within the context of gut microbiome studies. Here, we present a proof-of-concept study assessing whether fecal metagenome data could be used to assess STH infection, and to relate STH infection to microbiome features. We leveraged 310 gut metagenomes obtained from mother-child pairs in two different locations in Gabon: one rural and one semi-urban, and assessed the presence of four STH species (Ascaris lumbricoides, Strongyloides stercoralis, Trichuris trichiura, and Necator americanus) using qPCR. Sequence data were used to characterize the microbiomes and to detect these parasites. Metagenomic read mapping and genome coverage metrics closely matched qPCR detection patterns. Within-location analyses revealed that parasite species richness was associated with microbiome diversity and taxonomic composition, with the strongest associations observed in children from the rural site. Applying this approach to published data from five additional African cohorts identified context-specific parasite-microbiome associations, as well as a modest but reproducible association between microbiome alpha diversity and parasite infection. These findings highlight the potential of shotgun metagenomics for concurrent parasite detection and microbiome profiling across diverse geographic and demographic contexts.},

  abstract = {Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system (CNS) driven by genetic and environmental determinants. The gut microbiome of people with MS (pwMS) is distinct and influences disease through immunomodulatory metabolite production. Circulating metabolites are altered in pwMS, but identifying microbial-metabolic drivers remains challenging. We previously showed that colonization by the gut commensal Limosilactobacillus reuteri ( L. reuteri ) exacerbates disease in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model of MS, in a tryptophan-dependent manner. Here, we integrated microbiomic and metabolomic datasets from a longitudinal EAE study utilizing high and low tryptophan diets in mice colonized or not with L. reuteri . Gut microbiome dynamics under short- and long-term alterations in tryptophan bioavailability, were affected by diet, microbiome context, or disease. During short-term dietary intervention, L. reuteri colonization exerted a greater impact on microbiome composition than tryptophan bioavailability. With longer dietary exposure and EAE progression, high dietary tryptophan and L. reuteri colonization synergized to elicit profound microbiota changes, including alterations in Lachnospiraceae, Blautia , and Akkermansia . Integration of metabolomic and microbiomic datasets using joint Robust Aitchison PCA revealed clusters of associated metabolites and microbiota enriched for functional pathways, including bile acid and tryptophan metabolism. Metabolites outperformed microbiota in predicting EAE severity, identifying p-cresols and indoles as top disease-associated metabolites. Treatment with p-cresol or 3-indoleglyoxylic acid exacerbated EAE, enhanced proinflammatory T cell responses, and increased cerebellar pathology. These data demonstrate that dietary responses are shaped by gut microbiome composition and that integrated microbiomic-metabolomic analyses can identify drivers of disease worsening in MS. IMPORTANCE: MS is a multifactorial disease influenced not only by genetics but also by environmental factors, potentially including diet and the composition of the gut microbiome. We show that interactions between diet and commensal gut microbiota profoundly impact levels of immunomodulatory systemic metabolites, including several that are associated with disease in pwMS. Importantly, we demonstrate that individual gut microbiota produced metabolites are sufficient to worsen disease in a mouse model of MS. Integration of gut microbiome and blood metabolite datasets combined with subsequent predictive modeling, may bolster biomarker identification and the capacity to predict disease severity in pwMS, as compared to performance of individual datasets alone. These findings highlight metabolites as key mediators linking diet and the gut microbiota to neuroinflammation. Importantly, this work suggests that targeting microbial metabolites or modifying diet-microbiome interactions may represent new strategies to reduce disease activity in MS and related autoimmune disorders.},

  abstract = {The gut-liver axis represents a bidirectional and dynamic communication system between the gastrointestinal tract and liver, critically modulated by gut microbiota, bile acids, immune responses, and metabolic pathways. Disruption of this finely tuned axis contributes to the pathogenesis of several liver diseases, including alcohol-associated hepatitis, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease, cirrhosis, hepatic encephalopathy, and cholangiopathies like primary biliary cholangitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis. Dysbiosis, marked by reduced microbial diversity and dominance of pathogenic species, alters bile acid metabolism, increases gut permeability, and fuels hepatic inflammation. In cholangiopathies, the gut microbiome modulates immune dysregulation and fibrosis through complex microbial-host interactions. Emerging therapies targeting the microbiota, such as fecal microbiota transplantation, antibiotics (e.g. , rifaximin, vancomycin), bile acid modulators, and probiotics, show promise in restoring microbial equilibrium, improving liver biochemistry, and reducing disease progression. Precision medicine strategies integrating genomics, metabolomics, and microbiomics offer a tailored approach for therapy and prognosis. This review highlights the central role of the gut-liver axis in liver diseases and the potential of microbiome-based interventions to shift management from symptomatic relief toward disease modification and personalized hepatology, underscoring a new frontier in liver disease therapeutics.}

  abstract = {The microbiome of the gut is a complex ecosystem that contains a wide variety of microbial species and functional capabilities. The microbiome has a significant impact on health and disease by affecting endocrinology, physiology, and neurology. It can change the progression of certain diseases and enhance treatment responses and tolerance. The gut microbiota plays a pivotal role in human health, influencing a wide range of physiological processes. Recent advances in computational tools and artificial intelligence (AI) have revolutionized the study of gut microbiota, enabling the identification of biomarkers that are critical for diagnosing and treating various diseases. This review hunts through the cutting-edge computational methodologies that integrate multi-omics data---such as metagenomics, metaproteomics, and metabolomics---providing a comprehensive understanding of the gut microbiome's composition and function. Additionally, machine learning (ML) approaches, including deep learning and network-based methods, are explored for their ability to uncover complex patterns within microbiome data, offering unprecedented insights into microbial interactions and their link to host health. By highlighting the synergy between traditional bioinformatics tools and advanced AI techniques, this review underscores the potential of these approaches in enhancing biomarker discovery and developing personalized therapeutic strategies. The convergence of computational advancements and microbiome research marks a significant step forward in precision medicine, paving the way for novel diagnostics and treatments tailored to individual microbiome profiles. Investigators have the ability to discover connections between the composition of microorganisms, the expression of genes, and the profiles of metabolites. Individual reactions to medicines that target gut microbes can be predicted by models driven by artificial intelligence. It is possible to obtain personalized and precision medicine by first gaining an understanding of the impact that the gut microbiota has on the development of disease. The application of machine learning allows for the customization of treatments to the specific microbial environment of an individual.},

The findings delineate the intricate interplay between T2DM and oral microbiome dysbiosis, highlighting significant microbial shifts following periodontal and antidiabetic treatments, and pointing to the complexity of the relationship between oral health and systemic disease. The observed oral microbial shifts in T2DM underscore the critical need for standardized research methodologies in microbiomic studies, suggesting that by adopting a unified approach, future research can more effectively elucidate the oral microbiome's role in T2DM.

Since host-associated microbiomes at various body sites differ and diseases do not occur in isolation, a comprehensive analysis strategy highlighting the full potential of microbiomes should include diverse specimen types and various diseases. To ensure robust data quality and comparability across specimen types and diseases, we employ standardized protocols to generate sequencing data from 1931 prospectively collected specimens, including from saliva, plaque, skin, throat, eye, and stool, with an average sequencing depth of 5.3 gigabases. Collected from 515 patients, these samples yield an average of 3.7 metagenomes per patient. Our results suggest significant microbial variations across diseases and specimen types, including unexpected anatomical sites. We identify 583 unexplored species-level genome bins (SGBs) of which 189 are significantly disease-associated. Of note, the existence of microbial resistance genes in one specimen was indicative of the same resistance genes in other specimens of the same patient. Annotated and previously undescribed SGBs collectively harbor 28,315 potential biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), with 1050 significant correlations to diseases. Our combinatorial approach identifies distinct SGBs and BGCs, emphasizing the value of pan-body pan-disease microbiomics as a source for diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.},

While the amount of metagenomic data has grown rapidly, simple-to-use methods to analyze and compare across studies have lagged behind. Thus, tools expressing the metabolic traits of a community are needed to broaden the utility of existing data. Gene abundance profiles are a relatively low-dimensional embedding of a metagenome's functional potential and are, thus, tractable for comparison across many samples. Here, we compare the abundance of KEGG Ortholog Groups (KOs) from 6,539 metagenomes from the Joint Genome Institute's Integrated Microbial Genomes and Metagenomes (JGI IMG/M) database. We find that samples cluster into terrestrial, aquatic, and anaerobic ecosystems with marker KOs reflecting adaptations to these environments. For instance, functional clusters were differentiated by the metabolism of antibiotics, photosynthesis, methanogenesis, and surprisingly GC content. Using this functional gene approach, we reveal the broad-scale patterns shaping microbial communities and demonstrate the utility of ortholog abundance profiles for representing a rapidly expanding body of metagenomic data.

MAGs are extremely useful to analyze uncultured microbial genomic diversity, as well as to characterize associated functional and metabolic potential in natural environments. Recent computational developments have considerably improved MAG reconstruction but also emphasized several limitations, such as the nonbinning of sequence regions with repetitions or distinct nucleotidic composition. Different assembly and binning strategies are often used; however, it still remains unclear which assembly strategy, in combination with which binning approach, offers the best performance for MAG recovery. Several workflows have been proposed in order to reconstruct MAGs, but users are usually limited to single-metagenome assembly or need to manually define sets of metagenomes to coassemble prior to genome binning. Here, we present MAGNETO, an automated workflow dedicated to MAG reconstruction, which includes a fully-automated coassembly step informed by optimal clustering of metagenomic distances, and implements complementary genome binning strategies, for improving MAG recovery. MAGNETO is implemented as a Snakemake workflow and is available at:               https://gitlab.univ-nantes.fr/bird\_pipeline\_registry/magneto               .

As the development of computational methods for the recovery of genomes from metagenomes continues, existing strategies need to be evaluated and compared to eventually lead to standardized computational workflows. In this study, we compared commonly used assembly and binning strategies and assessed their performance using both simulated and real metagenomic data sets. We propose a novel approach to automate coassembly, avoiding the requirement for               a priori               knowledge to combine metagenomic information. The comparison against a previous coassembly approach demonstrates a strong impact of this step on genome binning results, but also the benefits of informing coassembly for improving the quality of recovered genomes.

Here, we provide the most comprehensive analysis of the canine and feline gut microbiomes to date, incorporating 2639 stool shotgun metagenomes (2272 dog and 367 cat) spanning 14 publicly available datasets (n\,=\,730) and 8 new study populations (n\,=\,1909). These are compared with 238 and 112 baseline human gut metagenomes from the Human Microbiome Project 1-II and a traditionally living Malagasy cohort, respectively, processed in a manner identical to the animal metagenomes. All microbiomes were characterized using reference-based taxonomic and functional profiling, as well as de novo assembly yielding metagenomic assembled genomes clustered into species-level genome bins. Companion animals shared 184 species-level genome bins not found in humans, whereas 198 were found in all three hosts. We applied novel methodology to distinguish strains of these shared organisms either transferred or unique to host species, with phylogenetic patterns suggesting host-specific adaptation of microbial lineages. This corresponded with functional divergence of these lineages by host (e.g. differences in metabolic and antibiotic resistance genes) likely important to companion animal health. This study provides the largest resource to date of companion animal gut metagenomes and greatly contributes to our understanding of the ``One Health'' concept of a shared microbial environment among humans and companion animals, affecting infectious diseases, immune response, and specific genetic elements.},

  abstract = {This study offers a novel description of the sinonasal microbiome, through an unsupervised machine learning approach combining dimensionality reduction and clustering. We apply our method to the International Sinonasal Microbiome Study (ISMS) dataset of 410 sinus swab samples. We propose three main sinonasal "microbiotypes" or "states": the first is Corynebacterium-dominated, the second is Staphylococcus-dominated, and the third dominated by the other core genera of the sinonasal microbiome (Streptococcus, Haemophilus, Moraxella, and Pseudomonas). The prevalence of the three microbiotypes studied did not differ between healthy and diseased sinuses, but differences in their distribution were evident based on geography. We also describe a potential reciprocal relationship between Corynebacterium species and Staphylococcus aureus, suggesting that a certain microbial equilibrium between various players is reached in the sinuses. We validate our approach by applying it to a separate 16S rRNA gene sequence dataset of 97 sinus swabs from a different patient cohort. Sinonasal microbiotyping may prove useful in reducing the complexity of describing sinonasal microbiota. It may drive future studies aimed at modeling microbial interactions in the sinuses and in doing so may facilitate the development of a tailored patient-specific approach to the treatment of sinus disease in the future.},

Exploration of this vast sequence space has been limited to a comparative analysis against reference microbial genomes and protein families derived from those genomes. Here, to examine the scale of yet untapped functional diversity beyond what is currently possible through the lens of reference genomes, we develop a computational approach to generate reference-free protein families from the sequence space in metagenomes. We analyse 26,931 metagenomes and identify 1.17\,billion protein sequences longer than 35 amino acids with no similarity to any sequences from 102,491 reference genomes or the Pfam database               3               . Using massively parallel graph-based clustering, we group these proteins into 106,198 novel sequence clusters with more than 100 members, doubling the number of protein families obtained from the reference genomes clustered using the same approach. We annotate these families on the basis of their taxonomic, habitat, geographical and gene neighbourhood distributions and, where sufficient sequence diversity is available, predict protein three-dimensional models, revealing novel structures. Overall, our results uncover an enormously diverse functional space, highlighting the importance of further exploring the microbial functional dark matter.},

The specific tools and parameters used in model construction such as data preprocessing, batch effect removal and modeling algorithms can impact model performance and generalizability. To establish an generally applicable workflow, we divided the ML process into three above-mentioned steps and optimized each sequentially using 83 gut microbiome cohorts across 20 diseases. We tested a total of 156 tool-parameter-algorithm combinations and benchmarked them according to internal- and external- AUCs. At the data preprocessing step, we identified four data preprocessing methods that performed well for regression-type algorithms and one method that excelled for non-regression-type algorithms. At the batch effect removal step, we identified the ``ComBat'' function from the sva R package as an effective batch effect removal method and compared the performance of various algorithms. Finally, at the ML algorithm selection step, we found that Ridge and Random Forest ranked the best. Our optimized work flow performed similarly comparing with previous exhaustive methods for disease-specific optimizations, thus is generally applicable and can provide a comprehensive guideline for constructing diagnostic models for a range of diseases, potentially serving as a powerful tool for future medical diagnostics.},

At the same time, it is now understood that diet plays a significant role in shaping the microbiome, with experiments showing that dietary alterations can induce large, temporary microbial shifts within 24 h. Given this association, there may be significant therapeutic utility in altering microbial composition through diet. This review systematically evaluates current data regarding the effects of several common dietary components on intestinal microbiota. We show that consumption of particular types of food produces predictable shifts in existing host bacterial genera. Fur-thermore, the identity of these bacteria affects host immune and metabolic parameters, with broad implications for human health. Familiarity with these associations will be of tremendous use to the practitioner as well as the patient.},

Although the first bacterium was described in the mid-1600s, the interest in community membership and function has not been a focus or feasible until recent decades. With strategies such as shotgun sequencing, microbes can be taxonomically profiled without culturing and their unique variants defined and compared across phenotypes. Approaches such as metatranscriptomics, metaproteomics, and metabolomics can define the current functional state of a population through the identification of bioactive compounds and significant pathways. Prior to sample collection in microbiome-based studies it is critical to evaluate the requirements of downstream analyses to ensure accurate processing and storage for generation of high data quality. A common pipeline for the analysis of human samples includes approval of collection protocols and method finalization, patient sample collection, sample processing, data analysis, and visualization. Human-based microbiome studies are inherently challenging but with the application of complementary multi-omic strategies there is an unbounded potential for discovery.},

By introducing dietary signals into the nexus between the host and its microbiota, nutrition sustains homeostasis or contributes to disease susceptibility.

Currently, the number of metagenomes in public repositories is increasing exponentially. The Sequence Read Archive (SRA) and the MG-RAST are the two main repositories for metagenomic data. These databases allow scientists to reanalyze samples and explore new hypotheses. However, mining samples from them can be a limiting factor, since the metadata available in these repositories is often misannotated, misleading, and decentralized, creating an overly complex environment for sample reanalysis. The main goal of the HumanMetagenomeDB is to simplify the identification and use of public human metagenomes of interest. HumanMetagenomeDB version 1.0 contains metadata of 69 822 metagenomes. We standardized 203 attributes, based on standardized ontologies, describing host characteristics (e.g.~sex, age and body mass index), diagnosis information (e.g. cancer, Crohn's disease and Parkinson), location (e.g. country, longitude and latitude), sampling site (e.g. gut, lung and skin) and sequencing attributes (e.g. sequencing platform, average length and sequence quality). Further, HumanMetagenomeDB version 1.0 metagenomes encompass 58 countries, 9 main sample sites (i.e. body parts), 58 diagnoses and multiple ages, ranging from just born to 91 years old.

  abstract = {Background There is a growing body of evidence suggesting that disturbance of the gut-brain axis may be one of the potential causes of major depressive disorder (MDD). However, the effects of antidepressants on the gut microbiota, and the role of gut microbiota in influencing antidepressant efficacy are still not fully understood. Results To address this knowledge gap, a multi-omics study was undertaken involving 110 MDD patients treated with escitalopram (ESC) for a period of 12~weeks. This study was conducted within a cohort and compared to a reference group of 166 healthy individuals. It was found that ESC ameliorated abnormal blood metabolism by upregulating MDD-depleted amino acids and downregulating MDD-enriched fatty acids. On the other hand, the use of ESC showed a relatively weak inhibitory effect on the gut microbiota, leading to a reduction in microbial richness and functions. Machine learning-based multi-omics integrative analysis revealed that gut microbiota contributed to the changes in plasma metabolites and was associated with several amino acids such as tryptophan and its gut microbiota-derived metabolite, indole-3-propionic acid (I3PA). Notably, a significant correlation was observed between the baseline microbial richness and clinical remission at week 12. Compared to non-remitters, individuals who achieved remission had a higher baseline microbial richness, a lower dysbiosis score, and a more complex and well-organized community structure and bacterial networks within their microbiota. These findings indicate a more resilient microbiota community in remitters. Furthermore, we also demonstrated that it was not the composition of the gut microbiota itself, but rather the presence of sporulation genes at baseline that could predict the likelihood of clinical remission following ESC treatment. The predictive model based on these genes revealed an area under the curve (AUC) performance metric of 0.71. Conclusion This study provides valuable insights into the role of the gut microbiota in the mechanism of ESC treatment efficacy for patients with MDD. The findings represent a significant advancement in understanding the intricate relationship among antidepressants, gut microbiota, and the blood metabolome. Additionally, this study offers a microbiota-centered perspective that can potentially improve antidepressant efficacy in clinical practice. By shedding light on the interplay between these factors, this research contributes to our broader understanding of the complex mechanisms underlying the treatment of MDD and opens new avenues for optimizing therapeutic approaches.,  Video Abstract Supplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s40168-023-01635-6.},

  abstract = {The therapeutic outcomes in major depressive disorder (MDD), one of the most common and heterogeneous mental illnesses, are affected by factors that remain unclear and often yield unsatisfactory results. Herein, we characterized the composition and metabolic function of the gut microbiota of patients with MDD during antidepressant treatment, based on 16S rRNA sequencing and metabolomics. The microbial signatures at baseline differed significantly between responder and non-responder groups. The gut microbiota of the non-responder group was mainly characterized by increased relative abundances of the phylum Actinobacteria, families Christensenellaceae and Eggerthellaceae, and genera               Adlercreutzia               and               Christensenellaceae R7 group               compared to that of the responder group. Additionally, the gut microbiota composition of the responder and non-responder groups differed significantly before and after treatment, especially at the genus level. Moreover, 20 differential metabolites between the responder and non-responder groups were identified that were mainly involved in lipid metabolism (cholestane steroids and steroid esters). Eggerthellaceae and               Adlercreutzia               displayed strong co-occurrence relationships with certain metabolites, suggesting alternations in the gut microbiome, and associated metabolites may be potential mediators of successful antidepressant treatment. Overall, our study demonstrates that alterations in gut microbiota composition and metabolic function might be relevant to the response to antidepressants, thereby providing insight into mechanisms responsible for their efficacy.},

To study the microbiome associated with premalignant colon lesions, such as tubular adenomas (TAs) and sessile serrated adenomas (SSAs), we profiled stool samples from 971 participants undergoing colonoscopy and paired these data with dietary and medication history. The microbial signatures associated with either SSA or TA are distinct. SSA associates with multiple microbial antioxidant defense systems, whereas TA associates with a depletion of microbial methanogenesis and mevalonate metabolism. Environmental factors, such as diet and medications, link with the majority of identified microbial species. Mediation analyses found that Flavonifractor plautii and Bacteroides stercoris transmit the protective or carcinogenic effects of these factors to early carcinogenesis. Our findings suggest that the unique dependencies of each premalignant lesion may be exploited therapeutically or through dietary intervention.},

We improved CRC prediction accuracy based solely on gut metagenomics (average area under the curve\,=\,0.85) and highlighted the contribution of 19 newly profiled species and distinct               Fusobacterium nucleatum               clades. Specific gut species distinguish left-sided versus right-sided CRC (area under the curve\,=\,0.66) with an enrichment of oral-typical microbes. We identified strain-specific CRC signatures with the commensal               Ruminococcus bicirculans               and               Faecalibacterium prausnitzii               showing subclades associated with late-stage CRC.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To characterise the gut microbiome in subjects with and without polyps and evaluate the potential of the microbiome as a non-invasive biomarker to screen for risk of colorectal cancer (CRC). DESIGN: Presurgery rectal swab, home collected stool, and sigmoid biopsy samples were obtained from 231 subjects undergoing screening or surveillance colonoscopy. 16S rRNA analysis was performed on 552 samples (231 rectal swab, 183 stool, 138 biopsy) and operational taxonomic units (OTU) were identified using UPARSE. Non-parametric statistical methods were used to identify OTUs that were significantly different between subjects with and without polyps. These informative OTUs were then used to build classifiers to predict the presence of polyps using advanced machine learning models. RESULTS: We obtained clinical data on 218 subjects (87 females, 131 males) of which 193 were White, 21 African-American, and 4 Asian-American. Colonoscopy detected polyps in 56\% of subjects. Modelling of the non-invasive home stool samples resulted in a classification accuracy {$>$}75\% for Na\"ive Bayes and Neural Network models using informative OTUs. A na\"ive holdout analysis performed on home stool samples resulted in an average false negative rate of 11.5\% for the Na\"ive Bayes and Neural Network models, which was reduced to 5\% when the two models were combined. CONCLUSION: Gut microbiome analysis combined with advanced machine learning represents a promising approach to screen patients for the presence of polyps, with the potential to optimise the use of colonoscopy, reduce morbidity and mortality associated with CRC, and reduce associated healthcare costs.},

Emerging research highlights the pivotal role of the gut microbiota in influencing CRC risk, progression, and treatment response. Metagenomic approaches, especially high-throughput shotgun sequencing, have provided unprecedented insights into the intricate connections between the gut microbiome and CRC. By enabling comprehensive taxonomic and functional profiling, metagenomics has revealed microbial signatures, activities, and biomarkers associated with colorectal tumorigenesis. Furthermore, metagenomics has shown a potential to guide patient stratification, predict treatment outcomes, and inform microbiome-targeted interventions. Despite remaining challenges in multi-omics data integration, taxonomic gaps, and validation across diverse cohorts, metagenomics has propelled our comprehension of the intricate gut microbiome-CRC interplay. This review underscores the clinical relevance of microbial signatures as potential diagnostic and prognostic tools in CRC. Furthermore, it discusses personalized treatment strategies guided by this omics' approach.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                            Each year, the American Cancer Society estimates the numbers of new cancer cases and deaths in the United States and compiles the most recent data on population-based cancer occurrence and outcomes using incidence data collected by central cancer registries (through 2021) and mortality data collected by the National Center for Health Statistics (through 2022). In 2025, 2,041,910 new cancer cases and 618,120 cancer deaths are projected to occur in the United States. The cancer mortality rate continued to decline through 2022, averting nearly 4.5 million deaths since 1991 because of smoking reductions, earlier detection for some cancers, and improved treatment. Yet~alarming disparities persist; Native American people bear the highest cancer mortality, including rates that are two to three times those in White people for kidney, liver, stomach, and cervical cancers. Similarly, Black people have two-fold higher mortality than White people for prostate, stomach, and uterine corpus cancers. Overall cancer incidence has generally declined in men but has risen in women, narrowing the male-to-female rate ratio (RR) from a peak of 1.6 (95\% confidence interval, 1.57--1.61) in 1992 to 1.1 (95\% confidence interval, 1.12--1.12) in 2021. However, rates in women aged 50--64 years have already surpassed those in men (832.5 vs. 830.6 per 100,000), and younger women (younger than 50 years) have an 82\% higher incidence rate than their male counterparts (141.1 vs. 77.4 per 100,000), up from 51\% in 2002. Notably, lung cancer incidence in women surpassed that in men among people younger than 65 years in 2021 (15.7 vs. 15.4 per 100,000; RR, 0.98,               p               = 0.03). In summary, cancer mortality continues to decline, but future gains are threatened by rampant racial inequalities and a growing burden of disease in middle-aged and young adults, especially women. Continued progress will require investment in cancer prevention and access to equitable treatment, especially for Native American and Black individuals.},

In this study, we predict the impact of resulting delays in screening (colonoscopy, FIT, and sigmoidoscopy) and diagnosis on colorectal cancer--related outcomes, and compare different recovery scenarios.Using the MISCAN-Colon model, we simulated the US population and evaluated different impact and recovery scenarios. Scenarios were defined by the duration and severity of the disruption (percentage of eligible adults affected), the length of delays, and the duration of the recovery. During recovery (6, 12 or 24 months), capacity was increased to catch up missed procedures. Primary outcomes were excess colorectal cancer cases and --related deaths, and additional colonoscopies required during recovery.With a 24-month recovery, the model predicted that the US population would develop 7,210 (0.18\%) excess colorectal cancer cases during 2020--2040, and 6,950 (0.65\%) excess colorectal cancer--related deaths, and require 108,500 (8.6\%) additional colonoscopies per recovery month, compared with a no-disruption scenario. Shorter recovery periods of 6 and 12 months, respectively, decreased excess colorectal cancer--related deaths to 4,190 (0.39\%) and 4,580 (0.43\%), at the expense of 260,200--590,100 (20.7\%--47.0\%) additional colonoscopies per month.The COVID-19 pandemic will likely cause more than 4,000 excess colorectal cancer--related deaths in the US, which could increase to more than 7,000 if recovery periods are longer.Our results highlight that catching-up colorectal cancer--related services within 12 months provides a good balance between required resources and mitigation of the impact of the disruption on colorectal cancer--related deaths.},

Due to its involvement in a variety of interactions, gut microorganisms have a great impact on our health throughout our lives. The impact of gut microbial population is been studied intensively in last two decades. Extensive literature survey focusing developments in the field were searched in English language Electronic Databases like PubMed, Google Scholar, Pubag, Google books, and Research Gate were mostly used to understand the role of human gut mirobiome and its role in different human diseases. Gut microbiome in healthy subjects differs from those who suffer from diseases. Type 2 diabetes, obesity, non-alcoholic liver disease, and cardiometabolic diseases have all been linked to dysbiosis of the gut microbiota. Pathogenesis of many disorders is also linked to changes in gut microbiota. Other diseases like cancer, arithritis, autism, depression, anxiety, sleep disorder, HIV, hypertension, and gout are also related to gut microbiota dysbiosis. We focus in this review on recent studies looking into the link between gut microbiome dysbiosis and disease etiology. Research on how gut microbiota affects host metabolism has been changed in past decades from descriptive analyses to high throughput integrative omics data analysis such as metagenomics and metabolomics. Identification of molecular mechanisms behind reported associations is been carried out in human, animals, and cells for measure of host physiology and mechanics. Still many the mechanisms are not completely understood.},

The short-read sequencing of variable regions in the 16S rRNA gene has commonly been used to infer bacterial taxonomy, and this has led, in part, to inconsistent findings between studies. Here, we examined mucosal microbiota from patients who presented with one or more polyps, compared to patients with no polyps, at the time of colonoscopy. We evaluated the results obtained using both short-read and PacBio long-read 16S rRNA sequencing. Neither sequencing technology identified significant differences in microbial diversity measures between patients with or without bowel polyps. Differential abundance measures showed that amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) associated with Ruminococcus gnavus and Escherichia coli were elevated in mucosa from polyp patients, while ASVs associated with Parabacteroides merdae, Veillonella nakazawae, and Sutterella wadsworthensis were relatively decreased. Only R. gnavus was consistently identified using both sequencing technologies as being altered between patients with polyps compared to patients without polyps, suggesting differences in technologies and bioinformatics processing impact study findings. Several of the differentially abundant bacteria identified using either sequencing technology are associated with inflammatory bowel diseases despite these patients being excluded from the current study, which suggests that early bowel neoplasia may be associated with a local inflammatory niche.},

  abstract = {Aim Colorectal polyps serve as precursors to colorectal cancer and pose a growing public health challenge with their increasing incidence. The potential role of gut microbiota (GM) dysbiosis in colorectal polyp pathogenesis has garnered attention, yet existing evidence remains inconsistent. This study aimed to compare gut microbiota differences between colorectal polyp patients and healthy controls using systematic review and meta-analysis using 16S rRNA sequencing data. Materials and methods Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, a systematic search was performed across multiple databases (PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane Library) up to April 2025. Only studies comparing gut microbiota profiles between colorectal polyp patients and healthy controls were included. Data was independently screened and extracted by two reviewers, and study quality was assessed using the Newcastle--Ottawa Scale. Meta-analyses were conducted with R (version 4.4.1) and Stata (version 18.0), with heterogeneity assessed via the I2 statistic and publication bias through funnel plots, Egger's test, Begg's test, and sensitivity analyses.Logit transformation was applied to enhance the accuracy and reproducibility of the analysis. Additionally, KEGG pathway data was utilized to explore the distinct metabolic pathway patterns between polyp patients and healthy controls. Key findings Systematic review and meta-analysis were performed by synthesizing 11 independent 16S rRNA-sequenced studies. Our analysis revealed that patients with colorectal polyps exhibited significantly reduced GM diversity, decreased Firmicutes abundance, and increased Fusobacteria abundance. KEGG pathway analysis indicated enrichment of the TCA cycle in polyp patients and more active amino acid metabolism in healthy controls. Significance Patients with colorectal polyps have distinct gut microbiota characteristics and specific metabolic shifts. These findings may facilitate the discovery of non-invasive biomarkers, guide personalized prevention strategies, and improve risk stratification for early intervention.

  abstract = {The human body is inhabited by numerous bacteria, fungi, and viruses, and each part has a unique microbial community structure. The gastrointestinal tract harbors approximately 100 trillion strains comprising more than 1000 bacterial species that maintain symbiotic relationships with the host. The gut microbiota consists mainly of the phyla Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria. Of these, Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes constitute 70--90\% of the total abundance. Gut microbiota utilize nutrients ingested by the host, interact with other bacterial species, and help maintain healthy homeostasis in the host. In recent years, it has become increasingly clear that a breakdown of the microbial structure and its functions, known as dysbiosis, is associated with the development of allergies, autoimmune diseases, cancers, and arteriosclerosis, among others. Metabolic diseases, such as obesity and diabetes, also have a causal relationship with dysbiosis. The present review provides a brief overview of the general roles of the gut microbiota and their relationship with metabolic disorders.},

Nevertheless, our current understanding of bacterial vitamin synthesis is primarily based on individual genomic and monoculture investigations, therefore not providing an overall view of the biosynthetic potential of complex microbial communi ties. In the current study, we utilized over 100 bacterial genes known to be involved in the biosynthesis of B group and K vitamins to assess the corresponding vitamin biosynthetic potential of approximately 8,000 human gut microbiomes. Our analyses reveal that host-associated factors, such as age and geographical origin, appear to influence the diversity and abundance of vitamin biosynthetic pathways. Furthermore, we identify gut microbiota members that substantially contribute to these biosynthetic functions at each stage of human life. Interestingly, inference of microbial co-associa tions and network relationships uncovered the apparent key role played by folate and cobalamin in equilibrium establishment of the infant and adult gut microbial communi ties, respectively.},

Traditional machine learning models often lack interpretability, which is essential for clinical and biological insights. This paper explores the application of symbolic regression (SR) to microbiome relative abundance data, with a focus on colorectal cancer (CRC). SR, known for its high interpretability, is compared against traditional machine learning models, e.g., random forest, gradient boosting decision trees. These models are evaluated based on performance metrics such as F1 score and accuracy. We utilize 71 studies encompassing, from various cohorts, over 10,000 samples across 749 species features. Our results indicate that SR not only competes reasonably well in terms of predictive performance, but also excels in model interpretability. SR provides explicit mathematical expressions that offer insights into the biological relationships within the microbiome, a crucial advantage for clinical and biological interpretation. Our experiments also show that SR can help understand complex models like XGBoost via knowledge distillation.

Real world applications often require classification into multiple (more than two) classes. For multi-class classifiers that produce class membership scores, a popular multi-class AUC (MAUC) variant is to average the pairwise AUC values [1]. Due to the complicated correlation patterns, the variance of MAUC is often estimated numerically using resampling techniques. This work is a generalization of DeLong's nonparameteric approach for binary AUC analysis [2] to MAUC. We first derive the closed-form expression of the covariance matrix of the pairwise AUCs within a single MAUC. Then by dropping higher order terms, we obtain an approximate covariance matrix with a compact, matrix factorization form, which then serves as the basis for variance estimation of a single MAUC. We further extend this approach to estimate the covariance of correlated MAUCs that arise from multiple competing classifiers. For the special case of binary correlated AUCs, our results coincide with that of DeLong. Our numerical studies confirm the accuracy of the variance and covariance estimates. We provide the source code of the proposed covariance estimation of correlated MAUCs on GitHub (https://tinyurl.com/euj6wvsz) for its easy adoption by machine learning and statistical analysis packages to quantify and compare multi-class classifiers.},

  abstract = {Background. In the last twenty years, new methodologies have made possible the gathering of large amounts of data concerning the genetic information and metabolic functions associated to the human gut microbiome. In spite of that, processing all this data available might not be the simplest of tasks, which could result in an excess of information awaiting proper annotation. This assessment intended on evaluating how well respected databases could describe a mock human gut microbiome. Methods. In this work, we critically evaluate the output of the cross--reference between the Uniprot Knowledge Base (Uniprot KB) and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes Orthologs (KEGG Orthologs) or the evolutionary genealogy of genes: Nonsupervised Orthologous groups (EggNOG) databases regarding a list of species that were previously found in the human gut microbiome. Results. From a list which contemplates 131 species and 52 genera, 53 species and 40 genera had corresponding entries for KEGG Database and 82 species and 47 genera had corresponding entries for EggNOG Database. Moreover, we present the KEGG Orthologs (KOs) and EggNOG Orthologs (NOGs) entries associated to the search as their distribution over species and genera and lists of functions that appeared in many species or genera, the ``core'' functions of the human gut microbiome. We also present the relative abundance of KOs and NOGs throughout phyla and genera. Lastly, we expose a variance found between searches with different arguments on the database entries. Inferring functionality based on cross-referencing UniProt and KEGG or EggNOG can be lackluster due to the low number of annotated species in Uniprot and due to the lower number of functions affiliated to the majority of these species. Additionally, the EggNOG database showed greater performance for a cross-search with Uniprot about a mock human gut microbiome. Notwithstanding, efforts targeting cultivation, single-cell sequencing or the reconstruction of high-quality metagenomeassembled genomes (MAG) and their annotation are needed to allow the use of these databases for inferring functionality in human gut microbiome studies.},

  abstract = {Background The stigma caused by colorectal cancer (CRC) and CRC screening affects CRC prevention and treatment. Based on the Health Stigma and Discrimination Framework (HSDF), this review analyzed the influencing factors and mechanism of stigma in CRC. Methods We conducted a scoping review in accordance with the PRISMA-ScR guidelines and searched PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and CNKI. The RoBANS tool was used for quantitative studies, and the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklist for Qualitative Research tool was used for qualitative studies. Data were integrated on the basis of the HSDF. Results Among the 15 included studies, 10 focused on CRC patients, and 5 focused on screening participants. These studies covered driving factors (14 studies), facilitating factors (11 studies), stigma ``marking'' (13 studies), individual experiences (12 studies), and social practices (13 studies). Additionally, a total of 3150 participants were included in the studies, comprising 2876 patients and 274 screening participants. Studies have shown that the factors influencing CRC-related stigma differ across different groups. CRC patients experience disease-related stigma and survival-related stigma, such as ostomy discrimination and employment discrimination. The screening of participants involves invasive examinations and asymptomatic population screening. The above stigmatization may lead to negative consequences such as deterioration in quality of life, decreased treatment compliance, delayed screening, and psychological distress (anxiety, depression). This study revealed that CRC-related stigma may be influenced by age, gender, religion, culture and the economy. Through improving social support and health policy, the negative effects of stigmatization can be gradually eliminated. Conclusion CRC-related stigma has measurable impacts on patient well-being and care-seeking. Although some studies suggest potential strategies to reduce stigma, further research is needed to evaluate effective interventions and their role in promoting screening participation.

However, we hypothesized that stool is a poor proxy for the inner-colonic microbiome and that studying stool samples may be inadequate to capture the true inner-colonic microbiome. To test this hypothesis, we conducted prospective clinical studies with up to 20 patients undergoing an FDA-cleared gravity-fed colonic lavage without oral purgative pre-consumption. The objective of this study was to present the analysis of inner-colonic microbiota obtained non-invasively during the lavage and how these results differ from stool samples. The inner-colonic samples represented the descending, transverse, and ascending colon. All samples were analyzed for 16S rRNA and shotgun metagenomic sequences. The taxonomic, phylogenetic, and biosynthetic gene cluster analyses showed a distinctive biogeographic gradient and revealed differences between the sample types, especially in the proximal colon. The high percentage of unique information found only in the inner-colonic effluent highlights the importance of these samples and likewise the importance of collecting them using a method that can preserve these distinctive signatures. We proposed that these samples are imperative for developing future biomarkers, targeted therapeutics, and personalized medicine.},

It has a prevalence of 10 to 25\% in the United States and has a high disease burden, as evidenced by reduced quality of life, decreased work productivity and increased healthcare utilization and costs. IBS has been associated with several intra-intestinal and extra-intestinal conditions, including psychiatric comorbidities. Although the pathophysiology of IBS has not been fully elucidated, it involves dysregulation of communication between the brain and gut (brain-gut axis) which is associated with alterations in intestinal motility, gut permeability, visceral hypersensitivity and gut microbiota composition.

  abstract = {Importance               There is growing interest in the role of gut microbiome composition in schizophrenia. However, lifestyle factors are often neglected, and few studies have investigated microbiome composition in treatment-resistant schizophrenia.                                         Objective               To explore associations between the gut microbiome and schizophrenia diagnosis, treatment resistance, clozapine response, and treatment-related adverse effects while adjusting for demographic and lifestyle factors.                                         Design, Setting, and Participants               In this case-control study of adults aged 20 to 63 years, stool samples and data on demographic characteristics, lifestyle, and medication use were collected and gut microbiome measures obtained using shotgun metagenomics. Participants with a schizophrenia diagnosis were referred through psychiatric inpatient units and outpatient clinics. Data were collected for 4 distinct groups: control individuals without a psychiatric diagnosis (past or present), individuals with treatment-responsive schizophrenia taking nonclozapine antipsychotic medications, clozapine-responsive individuals with treatment-resistant schizophrenia, and clozapine-nonresponsive individuals with treatment-resistant schizophrenia. Participants were recruited between November 2020 and November 2021. Control individuals were recruited in parallel through posters and online advertisements and matched for age, sex, and body mass index (BMI) to the individuals with schizophrenia. Participants were excluded if taking antibiotics in the past 2 months, if unable to communicate in English or otherwise follow study instructions, were pregnant or planning to become pregnant, or had any concomitant disease or condition making them unsuited to the study per investigator assessment. Data were analyzed from January 2022 to March 2023.                                         Main Outcomes and Measures               Omics relationship matrices, {$\alpha$} and {$\beta$} diversity, and relative abundance of microbiome features.                                         Results                                Data were collected for 97 individuals (71 [74\%] male; mean [SD] age, 40.4 [10.3] years; mean [SD] BMI, 32.8 [7.4], calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared). Significant microbiome associations with schizophrenia were observed at multiple taxonomic and functional levels (eg, common species:                 b                 2                 , 30\%; SE, 13\%; adjusted                 P                 \,=\,.002) and treatment resistance (eg, common species:                 b                 2                 , 27\%; SE, 16\%; adjusted                 P                 \,=\,.03). In contrast, limited evidence was found for microbiome associations with clozapine response, constipation, or metabolic syndrome. Significantly decreased microbial richness was found in individuals with schizophrenia compared to control individuals (t                 95                 \,=\,4.25;                 P                 \,\&amp;lt;\,.001; mean [SD] for control individuals, 151.8 [32.31]; mean [SD] for individuals with schizophrenia, 117.00 [36.2]; 95\% CI, 18.6-51.0), which remained significant after a covariate and multiple comparison correction. However, limited evidence was found for differences in {$\beta$} diversity (weighted UniFrac) for schizophrenia diagnosis (permutational multivariate analysis of variance [PERMANOVA]:                 R                 2                 , 0.03;                 P                 \,=\,.02), treatment resistance (                 R                 2                 , 0.02;                 P                 \,=\,.18), or clozapine response (                 R                 2                 , 0.04;                 P                 \,=\,.08). Multiple differentially abundant bacterial species (19) and metabolic pathways (162) were found in individuals with schizophrenia, which were primarily associated with treatment resistance and clozapine exposure.                                                        Conclusions and Relevance               The findings in this study are consistent with the idea that clozapine induces alterations to gut microbiome composition, although the possibility that preexisting microbiome differences contribute to treatment resistance cannot be ruled out. These findings suggest that prior reports of microbiome alterations in individuals with chronic schizophrenia may be due to medication or lifestyle factors and that future studies should incorporate these variables in their design and interpretation.},

Under normal conditions, the gut microbiome acts as a barrier to other pathogens or infections in the intestine and modulates inflammation by affecting the host immune system. These gut microbiota are not only related to the intestinal inflammation associated with tumorigenesis but also modulation of the anti-cancer immune response. Thus, they are associated with tumor progression and anti-cancer treatment efficacy. Studies have shown that the gut microbiota can be used as biomarkers to predict the effect of immunotherapy and improve the efficacy of immunotherapy in treating CRC through modulation.

  abstract = {Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) wait months and undergo numerous invasive procedures between the initial appearance of symptoms and receiving a diagnosis. In order to reduce time until diagnosis and improve patient wellbeing, machine learning algorithms capable of diagnosing IBD from the gut microbiome's composition are currently being explored. To date, these models have had limited clinical application due to decreased performance when applied to a new cohort of patient samples. Various methods have been developed to analyze microbiome data which may improve the generalizability of machine learning IBD diagnostic tests. With an abundance of methods, there is a need to benchmark the performance and generalizability of various machine learning pipelines (from data processing to training a machine learning model) for microbiome-based IBD diagnostic tools. We collected fifteen 16S rRNA microbiome datasets (7,707 samples) from North America to benchmark combinations of gut microbiome features, data normalization and transformation methods, batch effect correction methods, and machine learning models. Pipeline generalizability to new cohorts of patients was evaluated with two binary classification metrics following leave-one-dataset-out cross (LODO) validation, where all samples from one study were left out of the training set and tested upon. We demonstrate that taxonomic features processed with a compositional transformation method and batch effect correction with the naive zero-centering method attain the best classification performance. In addition, machine learning models that identify non-linear decision boundaries between labels are more generalizable than those that are linearly constrained. Lastly, we illustrate the importance of generating a curated training dataset to ensure similar performance across patient demographics. These findings will help improve the generalizability of machine learning models as we move towards non-invasive diagnostic and disease management tools for patients with IBD.},

'patchwork' is a package that expands the API to allow for  arbitrarily complex composition of plots by, among others, providing  mathematical operators for combining multiple plots. Other packages that try  to address this need (but with a different approach) are 'gridExtra' and  'cowplot'.},

  abstract = {In most cases of sporadic colorectal cancers, tumorigenesis is a multistep process, involving genomic alterations in parallel with morphologic changes. In addition, accumulating evidence suggests that the human gut microbiome is linked to the development of colorectal cancer. Here we performed fecal metagenomic and metabolomic studies on samples from a large cohort of 616\,participants who underwent colonoscopy to assess taxonomic and functional characteristics of gut microbiota and metabolites. Microbiome and metabolome shifts were apparent in cases of multiple polypoid adenomas and intramucosal carcinomas, in addition to more advanced lesions. We found two distinct patterns of microbiome elevations. First, the relative abundance of Fusobacterium nucleatum spp. was significantly (P\,{$<$}\,0.005) elevated continuously from intramucosal carcinoma to more advanced stages. Second, Atopobium parvulum and Actinomyces odontolyticus, which co-occurred in intramucosal carcinomas, were significantly (P\,{$<$}\,0.005) increased only in multiple polypoid adenomas and/or intramucosal carcinomas. Metabolome analyses showed that branched-chain amino acids and phenylalanine were significantly (P\,{$<$}\,0.005) increased in intramucosal carcinomas and bile acids, including deoxycholate, were significantly (P\,{$<$}\,0.005) elevated in multiple polypoid adenomas and/or intramucosal carcinomas. We identified metagenomic and metabolomic markers to discriminate cases of intramucosal carcinoma from the healthy controls. Our large-cohort multi-omics data indicate that shifts in the microbiome and metabolome occur from the very early stages of the development of colorectal cancer, which is of possible etiological and diagnostic importance.}
